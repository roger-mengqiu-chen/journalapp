# journalapp

 ![Backend Build](https://github.com/roger-mengqiu-chen/journalapp/actions/workflows/django.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

A simple application to help myself manage data from life (e.g., bank transactions, important events, people I met, etc.)

I am learning Django through this project. 

Mangement of data is done through Django admin site. I may create an UI to display data in the future. 

sqlite is used as database. It's much more portable than other databases and sufficient enough for personal use
