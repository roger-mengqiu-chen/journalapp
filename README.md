# journalapp

A simple application to help myself manage data from life (e.g., bank transactions, important events, people I met, etc.)

I am learning Django through this project. 

Mangement of data is done through Django admin site. Maybe create an UI to display data in the future. 

sqlite is used as database. It's much more portable than other databases and sufficient enough for personal use

Here's the notion page used to manage this project: https://rogermchen.notion.site/4b57d2a578934aee89967b098759635a?v=1882229ebb81474283b30f200eb86bc8
